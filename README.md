FastGCpeakCalc

Author: Dušan Materić

This script is used for chromatogram peak extraction for FastGC-PTR-Tof-MS (IONICON Analytik, Austria).
Please add the peak integration points (times) in $t1s and $t1e variables. 

As the input program takes the chromatograms that are generated by PTR-MS-norm script or files containing following columns: retention time [s], norm-Ion1 [ncps], norm-ion2 [ncps]…
The program should be executed from the folder where the chromatograms are saved as txt files; it will apply the retention time windows to all chromatograms and generate a report file.
